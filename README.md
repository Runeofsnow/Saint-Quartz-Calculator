# Saint-Quartz-Calculator

This project is designed to allow the user to determine the approximate amount of Saint Quartz you will have after a set period of time. Unlike the existing calculator, this one is run from the command line and accounts for the SQ obtained from events.

The program assumes that the user completes events in their entirety and as such is has tenative placements for events based on release order in JP. There are two glaring holes in this however: one the download campaigns are not included as they can be at different times from their counterparts in addition to varying because of the difference between the servers. Two this also guesses at some releases because of the difference in Anniversaries between Servers.

The program also assumes that the user has a login streak of at least 100. There is an error in the login streak as it was though it occurs ever 30 days rather than every 50.
